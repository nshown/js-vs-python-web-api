# Web APIs Made With Python and JavaScript

Web APIs are a great way to share and consume data.  **Python** and **JavaScript** both offer excellent options for creating Web APIs.

In this repository I created two Web APIs that function identically, one in Python and one in JavaScript.  

Both Web APIs offer the following 4 routes:
- `/` returns a simple text message.
- `/simple-json` returns a JSON string created within each route.
- `/sqlite-json` returns a JSON string derived from a SQLite database.
- `/paused-json` returns a JSON string after a pause.

The Python Web API was created using Flask and the JavaScript Web API was made using Node and Express.

Python, as ever, offers easier to read code while JavaScript is more performant.  Both are excellent options for creating a Web API.  Which you choose should rely mainly on which language you and your team is most comfortable with and if there are any additional features provided by either language that may be helpful in producing a solid Web API.
